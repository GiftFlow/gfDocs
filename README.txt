Hello!

This repo is up live at code.giftflow.org for you to browse. The goal is to keep all documentation relevant to GiftFlow in one
easily accesible place. If you can think of anything that needs adding please let us know.

This repo is a collection of documentation that should be helpful for working on a GiftFlow project.

We have the documentation guides for CodeIgniter as well as a map of GiftFlow use cases

The CodeIgniter docs are great to have on your local machine for working offline, just open the
directory with your browser and you can access it all throught the easy interface.

Of course if you have any questions, do not hesitate to ask!
-Hans
