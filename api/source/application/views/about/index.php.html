<a name="line4"></a>		<p class='nicebigtext'><span style='color:black; font-weight: bold;'>GiftFlow is a community</span> where you can get involved by getting things you need for free and finding people who need the stuff you have to give away. GiftFlow connects community organizations, businesses, governments and neighbors into a giant network of reciprocity, where they can share resources, meet each others' needs and coordinate their efforts to build a better world. GiftFlow is here so that people can work cooperatively without the need for money.</p>
<a name="line5"></a>	</div>
<a name="line6"></a></div>
<a name="line7"></a><!--
<a name="line8"></a><h2>The Idea</h2>
<a name="line9"></a>
<a name="line10"></a><p>GiftFlow is an online gift economy that connects neighbors in need with neighbors who can help. Users post what they need and what they have to give away. There is only one rule: the use of money is banned. Instead, users barter, share or give. They then record and review each interaction, documenting each other’s generous efforts.</p>
<a name="line11"></a><h2>How It Will work</h2>
<a name="line12"></a>
<a name="line13"></a>      <p>Each member lists on their profile everything they need and everything they have to give away, barter or share. This can range from an extra frying pan to an hour of their time. Through the network, users search for local matches and contact people, making offers and requests. Each user’s “gift history” contains reviews written by every person they interact with. This enables users to evaluate another’s net effect on the system and reward them for having taken little and given much.</p>
<a name="line14"></a><p><em>Groups</em></p>
<a name="line15"></a>     <p>GiftFlow is able to scale easily between individuals and large groups. Effort involving more than one individual can be directed through group profiles. Managed by individual members, each group can request inputs and offer outputs. For instance, an urban farm could start a group profile. The profile would document the contributions of each member, request tools and volunteers and offer fresh vegetables.</p>
<a name="line16"></a><h3>Social Opportunities</h3>
<a name="line17"></a>
<a name="line18"></a>      <p>There are many ways in which the website will be useful, depending on each user’s particular need. The strength of the site will be in how it connects different communities, enabling them to cooperate for mutual benefit.
<a name="line19"></a>
<a name="line20"></a>     <p> Users can use the site to give away unwanted possessions. Most major donation centers like Goodwill Industries or Salvation Army sell a large percentage of what they receive to international textile dealers who then sell the used clothing to third world countries.1 Through TheGiftEconomy, users will be able to give directly to members of their own community, connecting them with their neighbors.
<a name="line21"></a>
<a name="line22"></a>      <p>Those who find themselves unemployed and excluded from the monetary economy can use GiftFlow to find opportunities to work. By posting their available skills and hours to work, people can find others who need their help. They can then give or barter their time, contributing to the community and earning what they need in return. As they participate more, accumulating positive reviews and a history of good work, their profiles will function as powerful resumes.
<a name="line23"></a>
<a name="line24"></a>      <p>The site will also be helpful for existing groups and organizations. Non-profits can document the good work they already do for the community and solicit needed donations and volunteers. Then, those who volunteer for them can post their efforts on GiftFlow. Utilizing the reciprocity of TheGiftEconomy means that working to improve one’s community no longer comes at a cost for the individual.
<a name="line25"></a>
<a name="line26"></a><h2>Our Organization</h2>
<a name="line27"></a>
<a name="line28"></a>    <p>The team behind GiftFlow brings a wide range of experience and talents. Our founders are Hans Schoenburg, Leon Noel, Brandon Jackson and Cris Shirley. This is Leon’s third start-up website, his other successes are listfullofhope.com and socialsci.com. Brandon is an experienced web programmer (brandonsdesign.com). Cris is the founder of the New Haven Bike Collective and an environmental activist. Hans is a political activist and organizer with experience ranging from Capitol Hill to New Haven grassroots efforts. Leon, Cris and Hans have all worked extensively with many different community groups and schools in New Haven. These connections are crucial for the success of the site.
<a name="line29"></a>
<a name="line30"></a><p>As Yale students we have plugged into existing on-campus organizations and recruited a larger support group of alpha testers. These people will not only help us test and improve the site, but to launch it to the greater New Haven area in the coming months. </p>
